# 🎯 Trading API Integration - Test & Report Guide

## ✅ Integration Complete!

I've successfully integrated the trading backend API with the web frontend. Here's what you need to do to test and report back.

---

## 🧪 STEP 1: Open the Test Page

**A browser window should have opened automatically with the test page.**

If not, manually open:

```
F:\WeNews\web-frontend\test-trading-integration.html
```

---

## 📋 STEP 2: Follow These Tests in Order

### ✅ Test 1: Login (Step 1 on the page)

**Default credentials already filled:**

- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

**Click "Login" button**

**✅ What you SHOULD see:**

- Green box with "Login successful!"
- Token displayed (starts with "eyJ...")
- User email shown

**❌ If you see an error:**

- Report: "Login failed with message: [error message]"
- Try different credentials if needed

---

### ✅ Test 2: Get Active Rounds (Step 2)

**Select Round Type:** Colour (or leave as "All Types")

**Click "Get Active Rounds" button**

**✅ What you SHOULD see:**

- Green box showing list of active rounds
- Each round shows:
  - Round ID (e.g., "abcd1234...")
  - Round Number (e.g., "1")
  - Type (e.g., "colour")
  - Status (e.g., "active")
  - Total Trades count

**📝 IMPORTANT:**

- The first round ID will be auto-filled in Step 4
- Copy the Round ID for later tests

**❌ If you see:**

- "No active rounds found" → Report: "No active trading rounds available"
- Error message → Report: "Failed to get rounds: [error message]"

---

### ✅ Test 3: Check Wallet Balance (Step 3)

**Click "Get Wallet Balance" button**

**✅ What you SHOULD see:**

- Green box showing:
  - Balance: ₹[amount]
  - Formatted: ₹[formatted amount]
  - Status: active
  - Can Trade: Yes

**📝 Note your balance for next test!**

**❌ If you see:**

- Balance: ₹0 → Report: "Wallet has no balance, cannot test trading"
- Status: inactive → Report: "Wallet is inactive"
- Error → Report: "Failed to get wallet: [error message]"

---

### ✅ Test 4: Place a Trade (Step 4)

**⚠️ THIS WILL DEDUCT FROM YOUR WALLET!**

**Fields should be pre-filled:**

- Round ID: (auto-filled from Test 2)
- Trade Type: Colour
- Selection: red
- Amount: 100

**Click "Place Trade" button**

**✅ What you SHOULD see:**

- Green box showing:
  - "Trade placed successfully!"
  - Trade ID
  - Selection (e.g., "red")
  - Amount (e.g., "₹100")
  - Previous Balance (e.g., "₹1000")
  - New Balance (e.g., "₹900")

**📝 VERIFY:**

- New Balance = Previous Balance - Amount
- If correct → Report: "✅ Trade placed and wallet deducted correctly"

**❌ If you see:**

- "Insufficient wallet balance" → Report: "Cannot test - wallet has insufficient balance"
- "Round is not open" → Report: "Round closed, need active round"
- "Round not found" → Report: "Invalid round ID"
- Other error → Report: "Trade failed: [error message]"

---

### ✅ Test 5: View My Trades (Step 5)

**Click "Get My Trades" button**

**✅ What you SHOULD see:**

- Green box showing:
  - Number of rounds with trades
  - For each round:
    - Round ID
    - Total Amount spent
    - Color Amount
    - Number Amount
    - Status

**📝 VERIFY:**

- Should see the trade you just placed in Test 4
- If you see it → Report: "✅ Trade history displays correctly"

**❌ If you see:**

- "No trades found" → Report: "Trade not appearing in history (BUG!)"
- Error → Report: "Failed to get trades: [error message]"

---

### ✅ Test 6: Check Winnings (Step 6)

**⚠️ This only works for COMPLETED rounds**

**Enter a Round ID of a completed round**
(You may not have one yet - that's okay!)

**Click "Check Winnings" button**

**✅ What you SHOULD see:**

- Green box if you won:
  - "Has Won: Yes! 🎉"
  - Total winning amount
  - Result (winning color/number)
  - Current balance
- Blue box if you didn't win:
  - "Has Won: No"
  - The winning result
  - Current balance

**❌ If you see:**

- "Round results not yet declared" → This is NORMAL for active rounds
- Report: "✅ Winnings check works (round not completed yet)"
