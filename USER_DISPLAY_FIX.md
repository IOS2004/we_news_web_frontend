# User Display Fix - Missing Name in Sidebar

## Problem
- User name and email not showing in sidebar
- Only showing empty blue circle and "Wallet Balance ₹0.00"
- User was logged in but UI showed no user information

## Root Cause
The `AuthContext` was trying to verify the token by calling `getCurrentUser()` API, and when it failed or took too long, it would:
1. Not set any user data at all
2. Leave the user state as `null`
3. But still considered the user "authenticated" because token exists

This created a state where:
- `isAuthenticated = true` (token exists)
- `user = null` (API call failed)
- User can access protected pages but no name/info displays

## Solution
Changed the initialization logic to:
1. **Immediately load cached user data** from localStorage
2. Display the user info right away (fast UI)
3. **Then** verify token with API in background
4. If verification fails, keep using cached data instead of clearing everything

### Code Changes

**Before:**
```tsx
if (token && userData) {
  try {
    const currentUser = await authService.getCurrentUser();
    setUser(currentUser);
  } catch (error) {
    // Clear everything on any error
    localStorage.removeItem(STORAGE_KEYS.AUTH_TOKEN);
    localStorage.removeItem(STORAGE_KEYS.USER_DATA);
    setUser(null);
  }
}
```

**After:**
```tsx
if (token && userData) {
  try {
    // Load cached data FIRST for instant UI
    const cachedUser = JSON.parse(userData);
    setUser(cachedUser);
    
    // Then verify in background
    try {
      const currentUser = await authService.getCurrentUser();
      setUser(currentUser);
    } catch (verifyError) {
      // Keep cached data if verification fails
      console.log('Token verification failed, using cached user data');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Only clear on corrupt data
    localStorage.removeItem(STORAGE_KEYS.AUTH_TOKEN);
    localStorage.removeItem(STORAGE_KEYS.USER_DATA);
    setUser(null);
  }
}
```

## Benefits
✅ **Instant UI** - User info shows immediately from cache
✅ **Better UX** - No blank sidebar while waiting for API
✅ **Resilient** - Works even if API is slow or temporarily down
✅ **Progressive Enhancement** - Updates with fresh data when API responds

## Testing
1. Refresh the browser page
2. Sidebar should immediately show:
   - User initials in circle: "AM"
   - Name: "austin mark"
   - Email: "lostlevy@gmail.com"
   - Wallet balance: ₹0.00 (until wallet API loads)

## Files Changed
- `web-frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Fixed user initialization logic

## Related Issues
This same pattern should be used for wallet data:
- Load cached wallet balance immediately
- Update with fresh data from API
- Fall back to cache if API fails

This prevents the "flashing ₹0.00" on every page load.
